# Changes from the 1997 version

Companion to `local-trace-formula-2026.tex`. Prepared by Claude (Anthropic) for D. Joyner, 2026-11-10.

For each item of the errata log [`../original-1997/transcription_log.md`](../original-1997/transcription_log.md), this file records what the 2026 revision does with it. "R n" refers to the dated **Remark 2026.n** in the paper. Those remarks mark every substantive change and everything not fully verified.

**Dispositions:**
- **fixed**: corrected silently in the text
- **fixed (R n)**: corrected, with a dated remark
- **superseded**: the passage is replaced by new text
- **removed**: deleted (not needed)

## The Remarks 2026.n

| R | Topic | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | exponent in c_α | correction; non-split case not re-derived |
| 2 | Lemma 2.1: constant Q_G and chamber | correction; verified in rank one |
| 3 | §2.5 lemmas | Lemmas 2.7, 2.9 not re-checked against [Wa89a] |
| 4 | Casselman's asymptotics (3.1) | correction; generality of [Cas95, 4.3.3] not checked |
| 5 | Lemma 3.3 | correction; restated with the opposite parabolic |
| 6 | false claim on p. 18 | deleted |
| 7 | Lemma 3.5A (Brion) | new; half-open bookkeeping written out in rank one only |
| 8 | Proposition 3.6 | new statement and proof; checked in rank one |
| 9 | Lemma 4.1 and regularity | not used; (G,A)~-smoothness is insufficient |
| 10 | Proposition 4.2 | new form; confluence step written out in rank one |
| 11 | Theorem 4.5 | (a) unconditional, (b) under Hypothesis (R) |
| 12 | Conjecture 4.6 | new; verified for PGL(2), SL(2) |
| 13 | §5 | rewritten; normalizations checked only for SL(2) |
| 14 | §6.2 SL(2) | proved; also verified numerically and symbolically |
| 15 | §7 Route B | sketch; normalizations not checked |
| 16 | literature | bibliography status |

## Main mathematical changes

1. **Macdonald's formula** (Lemma 2.1): the constant is Q_G = Σ(IwI:I)^{-1}, and on the chamber A^- the coefficient of (wχ)(a) is c((wχ)^{-1}). [R2]
2. **Casselman's asymptotics** ((3.1), Lemmas 3.3–3.4): opposite parabolic, δ_P^{1/2}, regions A^-_P(ε), with ε depending on the level. [R4, R5]
3. **Lemma 3.5** (false) is replaced by **Lemma 3.5A**, Brion's vertex decomposition over the vertices T_Q. [R7]
4. **Proposition 3.6** has a new statement (vertex terms ψ(T_Q)·R plus a T-independent remainder J_G) and a new direct proof (partition of the dominant cone plus Brion), replacing the 1997 induction. [R8]
5. **Proposition 4.2**: I^T is an exponential polynomial in T, and I(χ,φ) is *defined* as its T-independent part. [R10]
6. **Theorem 4.5**: (a) the truncated identity holds unconditionally; (b) the spectral identity holds under the new **Hypothesis (R)**. [R11]
7. **Correction to the main claim.** For SL(2), (R) fails and the spectral measure has an atom at the unramified quadratic character (Proposition 6.4, verified numerically). New Conjecture 4.6 describes the general shape. [R12, R14]
8. **§5** is rewritten: signs of κ, the group 𝔇(S), the endoscopic groups H_m, the fundamental lemma (now a theorem), and Propositions 5.1–5.2, which answer the 1997 closing question. [R13]

## Other corrections found during the revision

- `common/references.bib`: Beuzart-Plessis (2020) is Astérisque **418**, not 417 (AMS bookstore; SMF catalogue, DOI 10.24033/ast.1120).
- The referee report's suggested repair M8(b) (smoothness of the (G,A)~-sum plus Riemann–Lebesgue) is insufficient. The (G,A)~-sum is smooth for each T but not uniformly in T, and the SL(2) example shows the limit can be a point mass. [R9]

## Changes of 2026-11-10 (second pass, at the author's request)

- Title page: "Revised, corrected and updated", authors David Joyner and Claude, dates 1992 / November 2026.
- NARC expanded (Naval Academy Research Council); the remark asking for it is removed, so the later remarks are renumbered (Remark 2026.1–2026.16).
- Bibliography labels changed to the form [Xn]: author letters plus the last two digits of the year (e.g. [Cas1] → [Cas80], [W] → [Wa89a], [Key] → [Ke82], [J] → [Jo97]). Entries are sorted by label.
- [Jo97] is now cited in §1 as the unpublished paper announced in 1997.
- The literature review (§8) is split at 1992, the year of publication, instead of 1997.
